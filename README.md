# GitHub Repository Naming Convention
## 1. Use Lowercase
Ensure all letters are in lowercase.

**Example:**
myproject

## 2. Use Hyphens ('-')
Separate words using hyphens for better readability.
**Example:**
my-cs-study

## 3. Be Specific
Use descriptive names to clearly indicate the content or purpose of the repository.
If you are creating a repository for a Tetris game, name it accordingly:
**Example:**
my-tetris-game-project

## 4. Be Consistent
Maintain consistency across all your project repositories. Follow the same naming pattern for different projects.
**Example:**
my-ping-pong-game-project
